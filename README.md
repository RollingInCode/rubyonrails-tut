# First Ruby on Rails Application
Before I studied Computer Science at UCF, Ruby on Rails was possibly the greatest challenge I have ever encountered in programming. It was my first time installing Ruby on Rails due to a book on "Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application" and an article claiming that Ruby on Rails is the best skillset to have in getting employed as a Software Dev. 

After countless packages installed on flutter pub, npm, and python pip, there was no way gem packages would have turned me down. The installation went by with ease and setting up a basic web app on Ruby on Rails was enough to say I got through it all. My first time trying this was in 2015, in my apartment back when I was in the Navy. I hope great things come with Javascript or Ruby.
